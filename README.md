## What is this?
Just a personal arch install script. You can check it out if you need some pointers on how to make your own, but I'm not claiming that it's perfect; I'm only an amateur myself, after all.

**I don't suggest running it on your machine.**

## Usage
1. Boot into the live arch environment
2. Clone the repo (maybe find a faster method later?)
3. 
```
chmod a+x pre_chroot.sh
./pre_chroot.sh
```
4. Sit back and relax
5. After the reboot, log in as the new User and do:
```
sudo /post_install.sh
```
6. Done!

> If it's only for your usage, then why do you need instructions?

Good question! Let's just say I forget things easily...
